I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), majoring in Machine Intelligence with a focus on Natural Language Processing. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://polimi.it/en).

My research interests include decoding and training techniques for language models, recommender systems, and knowledge graphs. Currently, I'm writing my Master's Thesis at [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) under the supervision of Clara Meister and Ryan Cotterell.

In my free time I like reading, [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/28181213) and other endurance sports.
