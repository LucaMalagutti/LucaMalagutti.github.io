I'm an Applied ML Scientist at Thomson Reuters Labs. 

Before this, I was a Research Assistant at [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by Prof. Ryan Cotterell. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://polimi.it/en) and my Master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

In my free time I like reading, [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/28181213), and practicing other endurance sports.
