I'm a Research Assistent at [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by Prof. Ryan Cotterell. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://polimi.it/en) and my Master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

My research interests include decoding and training techniques for language models, and knowledge graphs. I have recently finished writing my Master's Thesis on Divergence Functions for Natural Language Generation at  under the supervision of [Clara Meister](https://cimeister.github.io/).

In my free time I like reading, [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/28181213), and other endurance sports.
